## Appwrite Backend Setup

### Create an Appwrite Project:
1. **Sign Up or Log In:**  
   Sign up or log in to your Appwrite instance (Cloud or self-hosted).

2. **Create a New Project:**  
   - Create a new project and note the **Project ID** and **API Endpoint**.
   - Under **"Platforms"**, add a Web app providing a name and the hostname (e.g., `localhost` for development or your domain for production).

### Enable Authentication:
1. **Navigate to Auth:**  
   Go to the **"Auth"** section of your Appwrite console.

2. **Enable Methods:**  
   Enable the desired authentication methods (Email/Password is recommended).

### Create Database and Collections:
1. **Create a New Database:**  
   - Navigate to the **"Databases"** section.
   - Create a new database (e.g., `MomCareDB`) and note the **Database ID**.

2. **Create Collections:**  
   Inside the newly created database, create the following collections and note each **Collection ID**. Define attributes and indexes as needed (refer to `src/types/` or `src/lib/appwrite.ts` for potential schema guidance):

   - **profiles**
   - **appointments**
   - **medical_documents**
   - **blog_posts**
   - **blood_pressure**
   - **blood_sugar**
   - **weight**
   - **medications**
   - **chat_history**
   - **bookmarked_messages**
   - **forum_topics**
   - **forum_posts**

   > **Important:** Set appropriate permissions for each collection so that users can only read/write their own documents.

### Set Up Storage Buckets:
1. **Create Buckets:**  
   - Navigate to the **"Storage"** section.
   - Create the following buckets and note each **Bucket ID**:
     - **profile_photos**
     - **medical_files**
     - **chat_images**

2. **Configure Permissions:**  
   - Configure permissions for each bucket (e.g., allow authenticated users to upload, read, and delete their own files).
   - Consider setting file size limits and enabling encryption/antivirus if needed.

### API Keys (Optional):
- **Server-Side Operations:**  
  If you need server-side operations or admin tasks outside the user context, create API keys with specific scopes under **Project Settings → API Keys**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **Start the development server (with hot reloading):**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  bun run dev


# Build the Application for Production

Build the application for production using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
# or
bun run build
```
# Lint the codebase using ESLint
```bash
npm run lint
# or
bun run lint
```
# Preview the production build locally
```bash
npm run preview
# or
bun run preview
```
# Bash Deployment

This project is pre-configured for easy deployment to **Vercel**.

## Vercel Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**  
   Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Connect Repository to Vercel**  
   - Sign up or log in to Vercel.
   - Import your GitHub repository. Vercel should automatically detect it as a Vite project.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel.
   - Navigate to **Environment Variables**.
   - Add all the variables defined in your `.env` file (prefixed with `VITE_PUBLIC_`).  
     *Do not include secrets here if they shouldn't be public; Vercel handles build-time vs. runtime variables differently if needed, but Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for client-side access.*

4. **Deploy**  
   - Trigger a deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
   - Once finished, you'll get a deployment URL (e.g., `*.vercel.app`).

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**  
   Configure a custom domain in your Vercel project settings under the **Domains** tab.

## Other Hosting Options

You can host this Vite application on other platforms (Netlify, AWS Amplify, Cloudflare Pages, self-hosted server):

- **Build the Project:**  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  # or
  bun run build
  ```
  
## Configure Hosting

-   Set the build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
-   Set the publish directory (usually `dist`).
-   **Crucially**: Configure SPA (Single Page Application) redirects. All routes should redirect to `index.html` to allow React Router to handle routing.
-   Set up the necessary environment variables on the hosting platform.
